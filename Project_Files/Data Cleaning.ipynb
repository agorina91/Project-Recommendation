Awaiting episode #6!!!!!”\\', \\'“Can’t wait for more”\\', \\'“In 26 minutes of the first episode I heard more advertisements than I heard story about a vague story with no actual meat to it.”\\', \\'“Loved it!  Very well done in every way. Hard to believe that a human being could have such control and absolute submission of other persons. Next to COLD, this is one of the most fascinating podcasts that I have listened to.”\\', \\'“So what the hell happened!?!? Left me hanging! I want to know more!”\\', \\'“I want to listen to a podcast not ad after ad after ad. Have removed it from my library on iTunes.”\\', \\'“Super interesting. I can’t wait for the next episode.”\\', \\'“I was hooked from the first episode and can’t wait to see how it wraps up.”\\', \\'“So well done. A few decades of life imitating art told concisely and effectively. Perfect podcast.”\\', \\'“Unbelievable story. Cant wait for next episode! Hard to believe there are crooks out there hiding behind a therapist sign taking advantage of their own patients. Glad Marty got smart and broke away and is doing well. Marty trust your decisions!”\\', \\'“This podcast is well produced and interesting to listen to while I’m doing mundane housework (like the dishes). I’m only on episode 3 so far, but honestly, I don’t feel bad for Marty. He allowed all of this to happen to him. He isn’t an innocent bystander.”\\', \\'“This was probably the most boring podcast I’ve ever listened to.  I kept listening thinking for sure it would finally get interesting, but no, it never did.”\\', \\'“I’ve listened to episode 1-5 this afternoon, and I can’t wait for 6! I really like the story and story telling. I’m floored and hooked.”\\', \\'“This story is nuts. Great listen.”\\', \\'“Best podcast ever!”\\', \\'“So glad I found this podcast!  I just wish all episodes could have been released at one time (like a Netflix show).  Thinking I might have to binge them all again after episode 6 is released.”\\', \\'“Definitely a must listen for anyone who loves a good story. It’s also a warning about the power people can have over each other.”\\', \\'“Fascinating story about one of the most vulnerable and important relationships of our lives: patient/therapist. Also, Joe Nocera is a fantastically good narrator for this. Bravo!”\\', \\'“Naive codependent morons get taken advantage of. These people should know better.”\\', \\'“I’ve really enjoyed the wonder series. Listening to The Shrink Next Door and can’t wait for the next one!  Thank you for your excellent work!”\\', \\'“I can’t believe that this guy was able to do this to a patient. Hippocratic Oath be damned...”\\', \\'“What Ike has done to Marty and others is truly horrific. It is beyond unethical for a person in a position of power to exploit people who are extremely vulnerable. It saddens me that so many people reviewing this podcast are victim blaming, seeming to have no concept of what it means to be in a...”Read full review »\\\\n\\', \\'“How can so many people watch this slow-motion, 30-year train wreck and not try to stop it?  It’s a fascinating story that I wish went even deeper into how Marty finally came to his senses.”\\', \\'“Really enjoying the Shrink Next Door. Unlike some, it’s well written, well acted when necessary, and well told. Too often promising podcasts lose their focus and are poorly produced. Not this one. Thanks!”\\', \\'“I cannot get enough of this podcast!!! Fascinating and well told!!”\\', \"“I\\'ve listened to 2 and a half episodes.  Nothing has happened yet.  The bad guy has not yet committed a single crime.  Really hoping he hacks up the neighborhood in the next episode.  Fingers crossed.”\", \\'“I’m tired of murder mystery podcast. Happy to see something different. It’s an interesting story but sure it lacks the high pressure stakes of death...but man was this a weird story. I’ve heard of people being abused but 27 years is long. Worth a listen.”\\', \\'“Time well spent listing to this podcast!”\\', \\'“I don’t get the bad reviews. This podcast is very engaging and utterly repulsing at the same time. The fact someone can be taken advantage of by the person that they’re supposed to trust with their mental health is terrifying. I’m glad Ike’s true colors have been revealed.”\\', \\'“Great story right up to the point where there was no ending or wrap up!! We didn’t find out what prompted Marty to wake up or man up and get rid of Ike. Is Ike out of the business and is his wife out of the will? What was the background of the attorney who handled all the money business? I...”Read full review »\\\\n\\', \\'“This is a crazy story! You have me hooked! Great job on this podcast.. loving it &amp; cant wait until the next episode.”\\', \\'“I’m loving this podcast.  This story should be a movie.  Praying that Marty has peace now and Ike will reap what he sows”\\', \\'“So boring :(. It shouldn’t take more than half an episode to get to the actual story. I give up. I understand you need to paint a picture, but you could sum up that fact that he had lavish parties, an overwhelmingly extravagant house with custom features, and an obsession with celebrities, in one...”Read full review »\\\\n\\', \\'“When Marty, a multimillionaire said “I could have retired early” regarding holding personal information of a celebrity, I understood what this story was truly about.

Great storytelling and very easy to listen to.”\\', \\'“This is absolutely amazing. A true captivating story. Poor Marty ... just want to give him a hug”\\', \\'“I am taken with this story, and I crave the next episodes!”\\', \\'“Love the podcast!!”\\', \\'“One of the strangest stories I’ve ever heard.  I like the host’s style. There’s much more I want to understand.”\\', \\'“This story was fascinating! The narrating was excellent! I truly enjoyed while commuting to work!  Thank you for sharing.”\\', \\'“This show has me hooked. The psychology and storytelling is unparalleled”\\', \\'“This podcast is beyond boring😴😴”\\', \\'“I’m loving this podcast, but it’s frustrating to really only hear the one point of view!!
